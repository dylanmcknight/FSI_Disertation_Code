# FSI_Disertation_Code

List of Programs by Category: 
 
  1) Meshes: Raw mesh files for the square $[0,1]^2$ that both the Stokes and FSI Solvers call. Square41, Square 145, etc.
  2) Mesh Generators: Takes the mesh file (e.g. Square145) and builds the relevant additional mesh data structures (Taylor Hood, Hermite, etc.)
  3) Mesh Plotters: Plots Taylor Hood and Structure meshs after running mesh generation file.
  4) Solvers: Computes the approximate solutions of the time evolving FSI or Stokes problem.
  5) Error Computation: Computes the relevant errors of solutions.
